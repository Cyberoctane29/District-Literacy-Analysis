    "- Compute descriptive statistics to summarize district literacy rates.\n",
    "- Use the normal distribution to model the data and identify patterns.\n",
    "- Calculate z-scores to detect potential outliers.\n",

Descriptive statistics provide key insights into the distribution, central tendency, and variability of the data, helping me better understand patterns and trends. This step follows data cleaning and serves as a crucial part of exploratory data analysis (EDA), allowing me to assess the dataset before moving on to more complex analyses. By summarizing the dataset numerically, I can identify potential outliers, detect inconsistencies, and gain a clearer picture of the overall data structure."

# District Literacy Analysis
 This repository focuses on analyzing literacy rates across districts using descriptive statistics, probability distributions, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing. The project explores data through summary statistics, normal distribution modeling, outlier detection using z-scores, and point estimation through random sampling. Additionally, it constructs confidence intervals and performs two-sample hypothesis tests to derive meaningful insights. The analysis is conducted using Python with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, SciPy Stats, Statsmodels, and Matplotlib.
